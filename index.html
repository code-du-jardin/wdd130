        <p>Hi, I'm Abram, a BYU-Pathway student from the Philippines. I'm currently taking courses
            toward earning my Web and Computer Programming certificate. I am looking forward to
            learning more in these courses and develop skills that will help me in the future. My
            hobby is music—I love
            listening to music and
            playing musical instruments.</p>

        <p>The Philippines is a Southeast Asian country made up of over 7,000 islands, known for its beautiful beaches,
            rich biodiversity, and vibrant culture. It has a warm tropical climate, a history shaped by indigenous
            traditions and Spanish and American influences, and a population known for hospitality, strong family ties,
            and a love of music and celebrations.
